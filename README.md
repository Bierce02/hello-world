AboutMe = ("Hello everyone, my name is Eli. I am an aspiring programmer hoping to make a break through in tech. I have made games, apps, and a website(not the best). I enjoy coding and I made this account to show
my code and assist others who may need help with theirs as well. You may catch me on here once and a while asking for assitance or giving the assistance. Feel free to contact me if needed.")
